# Basement

It's not much, but it's honest work.

Honestly making the menu for this game is extremely boring but once it's out of the way and once i'm happy with it, i'll work on the gameplay next. 
It might take a while to complete this project but there's no rush for me :)

Not sure what else to put here, the only reason this project is public is because I wan't employers to see what my code is like :P

Thanks for reading
